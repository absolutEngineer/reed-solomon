Then we must reduce, because we have overflowed above the maximum value of 255. But, if we modulo 255, this will generate 256 == 1. Then 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. giving us a repeating pattern of numbers. This is very bad, as it's then not anymore a bijection (ie, a non-zero value doesn't have a unique index).

Because we are using precomputed look-up tables for multiplication: instead of multiplying a*b, we precompute alpha^a, alpha^b and alpha^(a+b), so that we can just use our lookup table at alpha^(a+b) and get our result. But just like in our original field we had 0,1,2,...,p-1 distinct unique values, in our \"LUT\" field using alpha we must have unique distinct values (we don't care that they are different from the original field as long as they are unique and distinct). That's why we need to avoid duplicated values, and to avoid duplicated values we need to use a prime irreducible polynomial.\n",
